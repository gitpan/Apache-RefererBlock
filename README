NAME

Apache::RefererBlock - block request based upon "Referer" header

SYNOPSIS

In your Apache configuration file, add something like

	PerlModule Apache::RefererBlock
	PerlFixupHandler Apache::RefererBlock
	RefBlockMimeTypes image/gif image/jpeg
	RefBlockAllowed http://www.mydomaine.com http://mydomaine.com
	RefBlockRedirect http://www.badguyse.com http://www.badguyse.com/images/bigpicture.gif
	RefBlockRedirect http://www.realbadguyse.com http://www.xxx.xxx/samples/tts.jpg
	RefBlockDebug On

All directives are optional.

DESCRIPTION

Apache::RefererBlock will examine each request. If the MIME type of the requested file
is one of those listed in RefBlockMimeTypes, it will check the request's "Referer" header.
If the referrer starts with one of the strings listed in RefBlockAllowed, access is granted.
Otherwise, if there's a RefBlockRedirect directive for the referrer, a redirect is issued.
Otherwise, a "Forbidden" (403) error is returned.
